# NOTE: CGO is required for ledger support to work, however goreleaser
# technically doesn't support CGO. But it seems to work so that's cool. This
# only seems to work because we are building for a single binary. Cross
# compiling binaries for multiple distributions doesn't work and a proper
# workaround will be needed.
